					<h3>The constrains</h3>
					<p>One of the principal constrains of this project was that it had to be developed with minimum involvement (or not involvement at all) of the engineering team.</p>
				    <p>Another factor was that although the project was a retention initiative it took place on the acquisition part of the website therefore it was of vital importance not to damage conversion rate at any point.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Get + users to "eat and repeat"</h3>
					<p>When this project started the filtering capabilities present at the website weren't enought for users to find the most appropiate meals to their taste, which meant the selection of meals could be a "hit and miss".</p>
				    <p>Starting with the idea of having a tailored allplants experience will make users more likely to repeat their purchase, the team set up to create an "onboarding wizard" to facilitate the users initial decisions and gather insights about their motivations for the marketing team</p>

								<h3>The process</h3>
								<p>First we ran a workshop on miro to ideate and align the outcomes that each part of the team wanted from the onboarding wizard.</p>
					    		<p>Following Lean Agile methodologies we came up with a series of experiments that would allow us to test our hypothesis quickly and with minimal effort.</p> 
					        	<p>Our main goal at this point was to confirm or discard the hypothesis that people prefered to be told what to choose rather than choosing themselves.</p>

							<span>Do users even want to take a quiz? Would they trust our recommendations enough to continue with their purchase?

								<h3>Success!</h3>
								<p>The experiments didn't damaged the general CVR of the website.</p>
								<p>Although the Click Through Rate to the onboarding wizard was lower than other call to actions on the website, its covertion rate was higher than other routes.</p>
								<p>After running the test for a few weeks and observing the behaviour of the cohorts the data proved that those who had the personalised box were more likely to reach box 2 that customers that have the "most popular dishes" box and than those who didn't do the onboarding wizard</p> 
								<p>At this point we added questions for segmentation targeting of the users for email campaigns and allowed customers to change the selection of meals recommended by adding a "customise" button.</p>
			
								<p>The use of engineering time was only necessary for the creation of the results template, the url containing different meals could be created by anyone of the team, and the onboarding wizard ran completely on typeform's logic.</p>

						<h3>The constrains</h3>
						<p>The new onboarding wizard was to be launched as part of the January Campaign. The campaign had new branding guidelines and messaging based on the premise that is ok to crave non vegan food and to "cheat" on veganism.</p>
				    	<p>Given the number of changes that were to be made on the wizard; we first needed to learn if we were making the right decisions via a typeform quiz before creating our own onboarding wizard from scratch.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Generating Delight</h3>
					<p>Althought we had proven that those who finish the quiz were more likely to convert, the number of users that were dropping off was high (over 50% in some cases)</p>
				    <p>The fact that the quiz was set on typeform meant that questions couldn't be changed or reordered without breaking the logic, long QA processes and the need for manual updating if one of the recomended dishes went out of stock.</p> 
				    <p>We needed an onboarding wizard that felt part of the <i>allplants</i> experience.</p>

				<h3>Final Designs</h3>
				<p>During an internal alpha release of the onboarding wizard it came to our attention the some users had problems differenciating between the navigation, progress and content of the quiz given the reduced colour palete of white, black, green an orange</p>
				<p>The styles were updated to make the content of the quiz obviously apart from the rest of navigation, error and information messages and retested.</p>
				<p>The current version of the onboarding wizard constains 12 questions that capture diet, intent, motivation, spice level, frequency, portion size and email.</p>

				<h3>The Outcome</h3>
				
				<p> With aprox 3000 new customers going through it monthly, those who start the new onboarding wizard today are 75% more likely to complete it compared to the old one. The onboarding wizard keeps converting at a higher rate than the regular shop.</p>
				<p> Customers acquired through the onboarding wizard are likely to sign up at a higher frequency than those acquired through the shop or other routes, with a high percentage of users leaving their email to keep up with the brand.</p>
				<p>The flow is fully accessible and can be completed with keyboard inputs, testing new copy and alternative questions is easier than ever thanks to optimize.</p>
                <p>We keep working to improve the onboarding wizard and add more capabilities to it to make it the perfect meal recommendation tool.</p>
